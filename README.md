# Pitchfork-Review-Text-Mining

Collaborated with UCLA classmates on Text Mining final project, March 2024.

The data set used can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/timstafford/pitchfork-reviews. Using natural language processing, sentiment analysis, predictive modeling, and other text mining methodologies, our goal was to understand the underlying trends across all album reviews on Pitchfork's website.
